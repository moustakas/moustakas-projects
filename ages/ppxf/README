Here are the steps for fitting all the spectra in AGES:

[0] BUILD_AGES_PPXF_TEMPLATES - build the template set; additional
support routines: ages_ppxf_velscale; ages_ppxf_instvdisp;
ages_pixel_size

[1] AGES_GET_ZABS_VDISP - Get reliable estimates of the
absorption-line redshift and velocity dispersion using PPXF.  This
routine sets the final sample that is fitted, namely, objects with
GSHORT>0 and 0.001<z<1.

[2] AGES_PPXF_PRETWEAK - Take the output from AGES_GET_ZABS_VDISP and
fit each plate/spectrum over a restricted wavelength range that avoids
the red leak and the fluxing problems in the blue for certain plates.  

[3] AGES_PPXF_SPECPHOT_TWEAK - Take the output from AGES_PPXF_PRETWEAK
and derive the average spectrophotometric correction curve for each
plate (see also AGES_CHOOSE_SPECPHOT_TWEAK).
  
[4] AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT - Take the output from AGES_GET_ZABS_VDISP
and AGES_PPXF_SPECPHOT_TWEAK and derive the final absorption- and
emission-line fits. 

[5] AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT, /BROAD - Fit the subset of broad-line AGN.

[6] PARSE_AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT - Parse the output from
AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT and write out the final data and spectrum
structures.

[7] AGES_MERGE_GANDALF_SPECFIT - Take the output from
PARSE_AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT and write out one uber-structure

Ancillary routines:

* QAPLOT_GANDALF_SPECFIT - build a QAplot for a whole plate
* QAPLOT_AGES_GANDALF_SPECFIT - build a QAplot for specific objects
