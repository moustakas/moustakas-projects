AGES/MZ README

### Build the samples ###

[1] Build the parent AGES and SDSS samples:
  build_mz_parent, sdss=sdss

[2] Build the AGES and SDSS emission-line samples and also classify
into AGN, SF, etc.
  build_mz_emline, sdss=sdss

[3] Compute oxygen abundances for the star-forming galaxies:
  build_mz_log12oh, sdss=sdss, agn=agn

[4] Build the SDSS2AGES comparison sample, with and without evolution:
  build_sdss2ages
  build_sdss2ages, /evolve
  
  
### Analysis plots (in approximate order of appearance in the paper) ###

[1] mzplot_sample - sample selection issues
[2] mzplot_agn - AGN identification
[3] 







[5] Fit the local and evolving MZ/LZ relations
  fit_mzlzlocal, /clobber
  mlfit_mzlzevol, /clobber


###
Simple modeling
* build_mz_pegase_models
* get_pegase_info - parse the output from build_mz_pegase_models
* mz_galform_model - simple galaxy formation model
* qaplot_mz_pegase_models - build some simple QAplots


# Make the plots

* mzplot_sample - sample properties
* mzplot_ohcalib - investigating the effect of various abundance calibrations 
* mzplot_mzlzlocal - establishing the local LZ and MZ relations
* mzplot_mzlzevol - evolution of the LZ and MZ relations

mzsampleplots:
* EWs measured from fluxed/unfluxed plates
* redshift vs absolute magnitude and stellar mass
