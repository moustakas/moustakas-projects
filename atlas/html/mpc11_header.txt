This file tabulates H-alpha and [N II] fluxes and equivalent widths,
Balmer absorption corrections, and ancillary properties for the 11 Mpc
Survey.  Fluxes have been corrected for Galactic foreground extinction
using the Schlegel et al. (1998) dust maps and the O'Connell (1994)
extinction curve.  Fluxes have units of erg/s/cm2; EWs are in
Angstroms, in the rest frame.  Upper limits are indicated with an
error code of -3.0, non-measurements have an error code of -2.0, and
"no information" is represented by a -999.  Absolute magnitudes are
computed assuming H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.  Galaxies observed during
photometric or non-photometric conditions are indicated in column
(09).  The aperture code in column (08) has the following meaning: 1 -
fully integrated; 2 - missing low surface brightness features (e.g.,
tidal tails, outer spiral arms); 3 - central spectrum, not truly
integrated.  Finally, column (23) indicates an whether the object is a
star-forming galaxy (HII), an AGN (AGN), or un-classifiable (Unknown).
