Define the sample in bcgmstar_sample.sex.  Use read_bcgmstar_sample() to
read it.

Build the object masks for all the clusters using the F160W band:
  bcgmstar_objectmask

Sky-subtract and pre-process the mosaics:
  bcgmstar_skysubtract

Cut out and write just the BCG image and model:
  bcgmstar_get_bcg

Ellipse-fit the BCGs; make QAplots
  bcgmstar_ellipse
  qaplots_bcgmstar_ellipse

Construct the radial surface brightness profiles of the sample and
then fit both single and double Sersic models in order to extrapolate
the data inward and outward.  Finally, measure aperture photometry in
logarithmically spaced radial bins and the total magnitude in each
band.
  bcgmstar_sersicfit, /dofit - Sersic fitting
  bcgmstar_sersicfit, /dophot - aperture photometry
  bcgmstar_sersicfit, /qaplot_sbprofiles, /qaplot_colorradius, /qaplot_seds - build some QAplots

Do the SED-fitting, compute K-corrections, and build the average mass
profiles (this code also collects the necessary strong-lensing mass
profiles)
  bcgmstar_isedfit

Get ancillary photometry for the sample
  bcgmstar_get_ancillary

  
### Paper plots ###

* plotbcgmstar_montage - build a nice color montage (Fig 1)
* plotbcgmstar_sblimit - box-and-whisker plot of the SB limits in our data (Fig 2) 
* plotbcgmstar_ellipse - show one example of ellipse-fitting 
* plotbcgmstar_sbprofiles - example surface brightness profiles + Sersic function fits overlaid 

* plotbcgmstar_ssps - build some simple SSPs; overlay the (K-corrected)
  BCG photometry and the models on a color-color plot
