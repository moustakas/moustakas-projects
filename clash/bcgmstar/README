Define the sample in bcgmstar_sample.sex.  Use read_bcgmstar_sample() to
read it.

Build the object masks for all the clusters using the F160W band:
  bcgmstar_objectmask

Sky-subtract and pre-process the mosaics:
  bcgmstar_skysubtract
  bcgmstar_parallelsky - analyze the sky in the parallel fields (for the Appendix)

Cut out and write just the BCG image and model:
  bcgmstar_get_bcg

Ellipse-fit the BCGs; make QAplots
  bcgmstar_ellipse
  qaplots_bcgmstar_ellipse

Construct the radial surface brightness profiles of the sample and
then fit both single and double Sersic models in order to extrapolate
the data inward and outward.  
  bcgmstar_sersicfit, /dofit_allbands, /qaplot_oneband - Sersic fitting
  bcgmstar_sersicfit, /qaplot_allbands, /qaplot_oneband - build QAplots

To read the cluster-specific Sersic-fitting results use:
  read_bcgmstar_sersic()
  
Measure aperture photometry in logarithmically spaced radial bins and
the total magnitude in each band.
  bcgmstar_photometry
  
Do the SED-fitting, compute K-corrections, and build the average mass
profiles (this code also collects the necessary strong-lensing mass
profiles)
  bcgmstar_isedfit

Get ancillary photometry for the sample
  bcgmstar_get_ancillary

Build the tables:
  bcgmstar_tables  
  
### Paper plots ###

* plotbcgmstar_montage - build a nice color montage (Fig 1)
* plotbcgmstar_sblimit - box-and-whisker plot of the SB limits in our data (Fig 2) 
* plotbcgmstar_ellipse - show one example of ellipse-fitting 
* plotbcgmstar_sbprofiles - example surface brightness profiles + Sersic function fits overlaid 
* plotbcgmstar_sersic - build some plots with our Sersic-fitting results

* plotbcgmstar_ssps - build some simple SSPs; overlay the (K-corrected)
  BCG photometry and the models on a color-color plot
