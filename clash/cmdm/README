First, read the compilation of spectroscopic redshifts for the
MACS1206 field, 'MACSJ1206_specz_Marc_compilation.cat' (N=2535) and
apply the following cuts in order to isolate cluster members:
0.4<z<0.48, which leaves N=799 objects.

Next, cross-match this sample with the Subaru parent photometric
catalog 'MACSJ1206_Subaru.cat' using a 3" search radius, which leaves
795 objects.  (I can match all but one of the "missing" objects using
a 10" search radius but at that point we may be matching to a
different object, so for now I'm going to throw away the missing four
galaxies.)

Next, incorporate Mauricio's sample of cluster members, which were
identified using the red sequence from the HST imaging.  The parent
catalog 'mem_209g_final.pelli' contains 209 objects, of which 119 have
spectroscopic redshifts.  For the remaining 90 objects assign the
cluster redshift, z=0.44.

Matching Mauricio's catalog to the Subaru photometric catalog using a
3" search radius gives N=201 matching objects.  It is not clear what
the "missing" eight objects are but it's likely due to the different
spatial resolution of the Subaru and HST imaging.

Combining both subsamples and removing duplicates leaves N=878 unique
cluster members.
