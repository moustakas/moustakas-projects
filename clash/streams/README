Define the sample: streams_sample.sex

* Sky-subtract:
  streams_skysubtract

* Build/gather the PSFs
  streams_build_psfs

* Find the BCGs and get some basic size & orientation measurements;
  writes out bcg_info.fits.gz file.  (This code is largely obsolete
  now since the info is gathered in other pieces of code.)

   streams_find_bcg, debug=debug  
  
* Process Marc's BCG models and then do elliptical aperture photometry
  (see also STREAMS_BCG_MGE)
  streams_bcg_postman

* Process Marc's BCG models and then do elliptical aperture photometry
  (see also STREAMS_BCG_MGE)
  
  

* Do a preliminary subtraction of the BCG (optional)
  streams_bcg_mge

* Process everything through dimage
  * streams_dimage, /parents, /stargal
