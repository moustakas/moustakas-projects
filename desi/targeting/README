  2014 March - original effort
  2014 June - updated to analysis of flux-calibrated spectra
  2014 July - README rewritten to reflect many improvements 

This README describes the construction of a sample of DEEP2 galaxies
from the Extended Groth Strip (EGS=Field 1) with well-measured [OII]
fluxes which will be used to optimize the DESI/ELG targeting strategy.

This analysis begins with my spectral analysis of the DEEP2/DR4
dataset (for details see ${IM_PROJECTS_DIR}/deep2/README).  The
results of this preliminary work are the following line-matched
catalogs for N=35682 galaxies with high-quality spectroscopic
redshifts (Q>=3) and 1D flux-calibrated spectra:

  * zcat.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - spectroscopic redshift catalog
  * weight.zcat.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - statistical weights
  * photo.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - ugriz/BRI+unWISE photometric catalog from Matthews+13 
  * kcorr.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - K-correct based K-corrections (for testing)
  * deep2.ppxf.specdata.dr4_v1.0.fits.gz - pPXF/GANDALF-based emission-line catalog
  * deep2.ppxf.specdata.fixoii.dr4_v1.0.fits.gz - same as above but with a fixed [OII] doublet ratio

With these catalogs in hand, I construct the DEEP2/EGS sample using
the following steps:

  1. First, fit the broadband (ugriz+BRI+unWISE) photometry at the
     spectroscopic redshift from DEEP2 using iSEDfit in order to
     determine K-corrections, estimate the continuum flux at 3727 A
     (around [OII]), and derive the stellar masses and SFRs (and other
     physical properties) for the galaxies in the sample.  Note that
     only galaxies at z=0.1-2 with photometry in at least 3 bandpasses
     are fitted.

       desi_deep2_isedfit, /write_param, /build_grids, /model_phot, $
         /isedfit,  /kcorrect, /qaplot_sed, clobber=clobber

     The fitting is carried out both with (sfhgrid02) and without
     (sfhgrid01) nebular emission lines.  (Note that the DEEP2 spectra
     are not used to constrain the fitting at this step.)

     The command above produces the following iSEDfit catalogs and
     best-fitting spectra of N=35682 galaxies (line-matched to the
     input DEEP2 photometric and spectroscopic catalog):

       desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid01.fits.gz
       desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid02.fits.gz
       desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid01_kcorr.z0.0.fits.gz
       desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid02_kcorr.z0.0.fits.gz

     Note that the current version of these models is given by the
     output of desi_deep2_template_version(). 
       
  2. Next, combine the pPXF and K-correct catalogs to generate a
     catalog of integrated [OII] fluxes.

       desi_deep2_isedfit, /build_oiiflux, clobber=clobber

     This code produces the following catalog, where VERSION is
     discussed above:

       deep2_oiicat_VERSION.fits.gz

  3. Next, build a statistically complete (flux-limited) sample of
     galaxies in DEEP2/EGS with a high-quality spectroscopic redshift
     (and spectrum!) from DEEP2.

       build_desi_deep2egs, /build_phot, /build_spec

     This script generates three catalogs: (1) a parent photometric
     catalog that contains BRI+ugriz+WISE photometry; (2) a
     photometric sample of stars (selected using PGAL<0.2), for
     comparison purposes; and (3) a parent spectroscopic catalog that
     contains all the same photometry plus [OII] fluxes:

       deep2egs-phot.fits.gz
       deep2egs-stars.fits.gz
       deep2egs-oii.fits.gz
