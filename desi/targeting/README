The DEEP2/DESI targeting and template simulations both start from my
spectral analysis of the DEEP2/DR4 dataset (see the related README).
The results of this preliminary work are the following line-matched
catalogs for 35,781 galaxies with high-quality spectroscopic redshifts
(Q>=3) and 1D spectra:
    zcat.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - full redshift catalog
    weight.zcat.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - statistical weights
    photo.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - ugriz/BRI photometric catalog from Matthews+13 
    kcorr.dr4.goodspec1d.Q34.fits.gz - K-correct based K-corrections (for testing)
    deep2.ppxf.specdata.dr4_v1.0.fits.gz - pPXF/GANDALF-based
      emission-line catalog, particularly for [OII] 

Next, I fit broadband photometry using iSEDfit in order to determine
K-corrections, estimate the continuum flux at 3727 A (around [OII]),
and derive the stellar masses and SFRs (and other physical properties)
for the galaxies in the sample.  Note that iSEDfit is run just on
galaxies with z=0.7-1.5, where [OII] is measureable in DEEP2
spectroscopy.  Specifically, running 
  desi_deep2_isedfit, /isedfit,  /kcorrect, /clobber
produces the following iSEDfit catalogs, line-matched to all the
preceding FITS tables:

    desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid01.fits.gz
    desi_deep2_fsps_v2.4_miles_chab_charlot_sfhgrid01_kcorr.z0.0.fits.gz

The next step are to explore the color selection criteria for DESI.
