First query photometry for the sample:
 build_redmapper_sdss - the output catalog is unique and pre-sorted
 build_redmapper_wise, /query
 build_redmapper_wise, /parse
 build_redmapper_galex, /query
 build_redmapper_galex

Then merge everything together and compute K-corrections
 build_redmapper_photometry
 redmapper_kcorrect

Run iSEDfit:
 redmapper_isedfit
