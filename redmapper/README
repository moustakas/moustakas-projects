Ancillary routines:
  * redmapper_path - set all the path names
  * redmapper_photoid_extract - needed by BUILD_REDMAPPER_UNWISE

The parent redmapper catalogs are stored in:
${IM_ARCHIVE_DIR}/projects/redmapper/catalogs
  
Build the photometric catalogs for the sample:
  * build_redmapper_sdss - create the input catalogs for CAS
  * build_redmapper_unwise - build the unWISE catalogs (must be run on coma)
  * build_redmapper_galex - RELEGATED!

Merge all the catalogs together and compute K-corrections:
  * build_redmapper_photometry
  * redmapper_kcorrect

Run iSEDfit - this has to happen on a rockin' machine, in chunks!
  * redmapper_isedfit, /build_grids, /model_phot, /isedfit, /merge_isedfit

Finally merge the redmapper and iSEDfit catalogs, split into satellites and BCGs
  * merge_redmapper_isedfit - merge the iSEDfit and redmapper catalogs,
