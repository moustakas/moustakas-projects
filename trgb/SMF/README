This directory contains the linked IDL and C programs to run
a maximum likelihood analysis on Keck and HST TRGB data.  The
C programs require the following files in the directory
/deep1/ioannis/lib/c/:

	nrutil.o (Numerical Recipes utilities)
	nrutil.h (definitions for nrutil.c)
	export.h (useful IDL conventions for C)

The program FORM_G is called by the non-C version of TRGB_MLIKE.
The shared object library mlike.so* is necessary for the C version
of TRGB_MLIKE to run properly.
